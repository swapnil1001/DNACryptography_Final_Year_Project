<p style="text-align: justify;margin:10px; padding:2px;">
Communication is the base for any sort of technology used but for some techniques the privacy in the communication should be maintained for data integrity and data security. Now data hijacking is a great matter of concern for which cryptography is a solution. Cryptography is the method of writing codes to keep the information private and safe from piracy. The messages of sender and receiver remain end-to-end encrypted providing security of the information. For higher levels of cryptography, it is very difficult for the hijackers to decode the encrypted code, making cryptography a sustainable way in today’s world of technological communication. Cryptography is a combination of two Greek words ‘Krypto’ and ‘Graphene’ which meant hidden writing. In networking system including data communication we can refer cryptography is the skill of encrypting the sender message to a non-readable secure code and again decrypting that code to send the original message to the receiver without any leak of privacy or errors.</p>
<h4 style="margin:10px; padding:2px;"><b>DNA Cryptography</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin:10px; padding:2px;">
Among many cryptographic techniques that provide data security the most encouraging method is DNA Cryptography. From the term itself we understand that security is provided by some means of DNA. In DNA cryptography, there is a carrier which is DNA and some implementation tools which the modernized biotechnological methods are, where every strings or characters are converted to the sequence of bases situated in a DNA. On the ground of cryptography, DNA is most dynamic as binding competence of the nucleotide bases cite the favorable circumstances of discovering self-assembly arrangements which are an exemplary form of enacting computations. A major asset in using DNA in cryptographic field in the huge capacity of storing data but a drawback is that it engages a lot of time for functioning.</p>
<h4 style="margin:10px; padding:2px;"><b>Classical Playfair Cipher</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;margin:10px; padding:2px;">
There are many existing cryptographic techniques, out of which there is a manual balanced symmetrical encryption cipher which was invented in the year 1854 by Charles Wheatstone that is called Playfair Cipher. In our project we will be using playfair cipher as a cryptographic technique to get the desired result. What happens in playfair cipher is that pair of letters, known as doublets are encrypted. At first in playfair cipher a key chart is made. The key chart behaves as a key as encrypting the plaintext. Every of the character must be exclusive. The initial character (from left to right) in the key chart is the idiom, excluding the duplicate characters. Several different methods are used to modify the security of playfair cipher like 8x8 playfair cipher having 64 spots with English alphabets and some special characters, but that wasn’t enough to satisfy useful characters in plain text. Hence a generalized 8x16 playfair cipher, which is 128 ASCII characters, is on research. In our project we will implement cryptography with DNA bases using a 10×10 key chart which includes 26 English alphabets both in upper case and lower case, integers from 0-9 and 38 other special characters including ‘Diphthong’ used as a filler character in between double characters and end of original message.</p>
